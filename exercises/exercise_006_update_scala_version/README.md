# Migrating the Scala version

If you made it so far, it means you're code has already compiled to Scala 3! It
is time to switch permanently to Scala 3 and to clean up the build.

## Steps

1. Change the `scalaVersion` to `3.3.0`
2. Reload the build and check that the main and test code still compiles.
3. Check that the tests run successfully.
4. Remove all Scala 2.13-specific dependencies and `scalacOptions` from the
   build.
5. Remove `sbt-scala3-migrate` from the build.
6. One last time you can reload and run the tests.
7. Commit your changes:

```shell
> git commit -a -m 'Finalize migration to Scala 3'
```
